WireWorld help
	Basic
		WireWorld cell
			The block carries WireWorld signals.
			This block turns into head if 1 or 2 neighboring blocks power this cell
			More information on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld
		WireWorld head
			Activates any gates, actuators and WireWorld cells in Moore neighborhood (unless otherwise specified), and then turns into tail
			More information on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld
		WireWorld tail
			Turns into the WireWorld cell

	Output devices
		WireWorld chatter
			If any signal is received in von Neumann neighborhood, a text message set by the user is printed in the log file
		Hello, world (modded block)
			If any signal is received in von Neumann neighborhood, "Hello, world" is printed in the log file
		Lamp
			Turns green if provided with signal in von Neumann neighborhood, otherwise turns red
	Input devices
		On switch
			Activates any gates, actuators and WireWorld cells in Moore neighborhood (unless otherwise specified)
			until clicked by the player or Block Clicking Claw
		Off switch
			Turns into active switch when clicked by the player or Block Clicking Claw
		Button
			Sends a Wireworld pulse in Moore neighborhood (unless otherwise specified) for one tick
	Gates
		2 inputs
			AND - activates only if both inputs are active
			OR - activates if any input is active
			XOR - activates only if one input are active
		1 input
			NOT - activates if input is inactive
			YES - activates if input is active
			Random - randomly activates with 50% chance if input is active, else it is inactive
			Toggle - inverts its state when it is activated. The state is retained when the game is closed. 
		Signallers
			Random - emits 8 separate random signals in Moore neighborhood
			Uniform random - emits 1 random signal in Moore neighborhood
			Always true - always activates any gates, actuators and WireWorld cells in Moore neighborhood (unless otherwise specified)
	Actuators
		Creative Block Placer
			Places selected block when activated
		Block Clicking Claw
			Click the block in front of it, subject to restrictions imposed by the block.
			This does not open GUIs, nor manipulate block contents.
		Block Rotator
			Rotates block in front of it
			When the Block Rotator is clicked, it switches direction
